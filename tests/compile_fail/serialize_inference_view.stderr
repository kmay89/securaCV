error[E0277]: the trait bound `InferenceView<'_>: serde::Serialize` is not satisfied

  = note: for local types consider adding `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]` to your `InferenceView<'_>` type
  = note: for types from other crates check whether the crate offers a `serde` feature flag
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Serialize`:
            &'a T
            &'a mut T
            ()
            (T,)
