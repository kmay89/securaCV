error[E0277]: the trait bound `RawFrame: serde::Serialize` is not satisfied

  = note: for local types consider adding `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]` to your `RawFrame` type
  = note: for types from other crates check whether the crate offers a `serde` feature flag
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Serialize`:
            &'a T
