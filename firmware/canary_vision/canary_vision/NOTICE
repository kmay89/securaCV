This firmware is designed to publish privacy-preserving semantic signals
(e.g., presence/dwell/interaction likelihood) and to avoid raw video
retention by default.

Any use intended to bypass, disable, or weaken privacy-preserving behavior
described in the SecuraCV documentation is contrary to the project’s purpose.
