# TRADEMARKS (SecuraCV / Canary Vision / Errer Labs)

This repository is released under the Apache License 2.0 (see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`).
**The Apache-2.0 license does not grant permission to use any project trademarks.**

## What is a “trademark” here?
The following names, logos, and related branding may be used as trademarks/brand identifiers:

- **SecuraCV**
- **Canary Vision**
- **Errer Labs / ErrerLabs**
- Any associated logos, icons, mascots, and brand marks
- Domain names and social handles referencing the above (e.g., `securacv.com`, `errerlabs.com`)

## Allowed (nominative) uses
You may use the names above **only as necessary to describe** that your software is
derived from or compatible with this project, for example:

- “Based on SecuraCV”
- “Compatible with SecuraCV MQTT topics”
- “Fork of the SecuraCV repository”

## Not allowed without permission
Without explicit written permission, you may **not**:

- Use the project names/logos to imply endorsement, sponsorship, or official status
- Rebrand your fork as “SecuraCV” or “Canary Vision” (or confusingly similar)
- Use the logos/mascots in your marketing materials or product UI as primary branding

## How to request permission
If you want to use the trademarks in a commercial product, distribution, or marketing:
open an issue in the upstream repository describing the intended use.

## Why this exists
Trademarks help users understand what is official, what is a fork, and what is compatible—especially
for security/privacy infrastructure where trust and provenance matter.
